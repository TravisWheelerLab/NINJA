# NINJA
Nearly Infinite Neighbor Joining Application



We use a "git flow" workflow. We have two active branches:
 * **master** is to become the stable NINJA release branch. 
 * **develop** is the NINJA development branch

To contribute to NINJA development, you want to be on the
**develop** branch, which is where we are currently integrating
feature branches. For more information, see the
[NINJA wiki](https://github.com/TravisWheelerLab/NINJA/wiki).
