# NINJA

Nearly Infinite Neighbor Joining Application

## About

This repository is an "almost complete" reimplementation of the Java implementation at [this site](https://wheelerlab.org/software/ninja/). The software generally works, but there remain a couple of small bugs, and the project is on hold (and not under active development) while we await the time to wrap it up to completion. For now, your best bets are to either:
* use the Java version listed in the previous sentence
* reach out to me (Travis Wheeler) if you are interested in contributing to the code

## Development

Clone the code. If you're on a Mac, you can run `make setup-mac` to install most
of the required tools through [Homebrew](http://brew.sh). This includes:

  - [compiledb](https://github.com/nickdiego/compiledb)
  - [doxygen](https://www.doxygen.nl)
  - [pipenv](https://github.com/pypa/pipenv)
  - Python 3.8 or greater

Contributions are welcomed. To do this, fork the repo, create a branch and, once
you're ready, create a pull request from your branch into the `master` branch in
the main repo.
