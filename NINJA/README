Quick NINJA README pre-release (05/14)

Compilation:
    Tested only on linux using g++, with the "make all" command.

Arguments:

--in (or -i) filename 
    Specify file (fasta format) containing precomputed pairwise distances.
    (default is to read the filename from the first argument not associated
    with a -- flag, as shown above) 

--out (or -o) filename 
    Specify file to which the tree will be written (default = stdout)

--method (or -m) meth  [default | inmem]
    'inmem' method uses in-memory algorithm, which is roughly 3x faster, but 
         will fail for large inputs. For example, with -Xmx2G (the default
         in the ninja shell script), inmem will work for up to around 7,000 
         sequences.      
    'default' inmem.

--in_type type [a | d]
    Type of input, alignment or distance matrix
    'a' type causes NINJA to accept an alignment in fasta format
    'd' type causes NINJA to accept a (phylip format) file containing 
    precomputed pairwise distances.
    Default = a
    
--out_type type [t | c]   
    Type of output, tree or distance matrix
    't' type computes the tree from the input file (whether an alignment
         or a distance matrix), and writes a tree to the file specified with
         the --out flag
    'c' type calculates a Nearest-Neighbor clustering of the sequences,
        and writes a table including a cluster identifier to a file.
    Default = t           
         
--alph_type type [a | d]
    'a' if input consists of amino acid sequence
    'd' if input consists of dna sequence
    Default = amino. 
    
--corr_type type [n | j | k | s]
    Correction for multiple same-site substitutions.
    'n' no correction
    'j' jukes-cantor correction  { dist = -3/4 * ln (1 - 4/3 * dist ) }
    'k' kimura 2-parameter correction { dist = -1/2 * ln ( (1-2p-q)*sqrt(1-2q) ) }    
    's' FastTree's scoredist-like correction { dist = -1.3 * ln (1.0 - dist) }
    'm' Mothur's onegap correction -- only counts a string of gaps as a single
        gap. This includes end gaps but excludes alignment padding. 
        { dist = (mismatches + gap_inits) / (matches + mismatches + gap_inits) }
    Default: 'k' for DNA, 's' for amino acid

--cluster_cutoff dist_cutoff 
    The maximum distance between two sequences for inclusion in the same 
    cluster.  Only applicable to the clustering method ( --out_type c ).
    Default: 0.03

--rebuild_step_ratio (or -r)  
    See paper for details.  Default = 0.5.

Execution:

./NINJA [arguments]

Example:

./NINJA -m inmem --in_type a --out_type t -i e_coli_1000.fa -o out.txt

Notes:

It currently does not support stockholm files and external memory. The behaviour for stockholm files 
is unpredictable, only fasta format works. The use of the extmem argument has not been thoroughly tested.
It currently uses SSE and multiple threads: the behaviour in the case one of these is not available 
is unpredictable.
