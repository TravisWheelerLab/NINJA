Quick NINJA README pre-release (05/14)

Compilation:
    Tested only on linux using g++, with the "make all" command.

Arguments:

--in (or -i) filename 
    Specify file (fasta format) containing precomputed pairwise distances.
    (default is to read the filename from the first argument not associated
    with a -- flag, as shown above) 

--out (or -o) filename 
    Specify file to which the tree will be written (default = stdout)

--method (or -m) meth  [default | inmem]
    'inmem' method uses in-memory algorithm, which is roughly 3x faster, but 
         will fail for large inputs. For example, with -Xmx2G (the default
         in the ninja shell script), inmem will work for up to around 7,000 
         sequences.      
    'default' inmem.

--in_type type [a | d]
    Type of input, alignment or distance matrix
    'a' type causes NINJA to accept an alignment in fasta format
    'd' type causes NINJA to accept a (phylip format) file containing 
    precomputed pairwise distances.
    Default = a
    
--out_type type [t]   
    Type of output, tree or distance matrix
    't' type computes the tree from the input file (whether an alignment
         or a distance matrix), and writes a tree to the file specified with
         the --out flag
    Default = t           
         
--alph_type type [a | d]
    'a' if input consists of amino acid sequence
    'd' if input consists of dna sequence
    Default = amino. 
    
--corr_type type [n | j | k | s]
    Correction for multiple same-site substitutions.
    'n' no correction
    'j' jukes-cantor correction  { dist = -3/4 * ln (1 - 4/3 * dist ) }
    'k' kimura 2-parameter correction { dist = -1/2 * ln ( (1-2p-q)*sqrt(1-2q) ) }    
    's' FastTree's scoredist-like correction { dist = -1.3 * ln (1.0 - dist) }
    Default: 'k' for DNA, 's' for amino acid

--rebuild_step_ratio (or -r)  
    See paper for details.  Default = 0.5.

Execution:

./NINJA [arguments]

Example:

./NINJA -m inmem --in_type a --out_type t -i e_coli_1000.fa -o out.txt

Notes:

It currently does not support stockholm files and external memory. The behaviour for stockholm files is unpredictable, only fasta format works. The use of the extmem argument will make the program abort, and if the input is too large to fit in memory and you use the inmem argument, the behaviour is unpredictable.
